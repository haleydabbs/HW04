Feed the plant

In this game, you want to feed your plant different resources so
that it grows a flower.

-- Goal --

There are three boxes on the right representing
your resources, pink is for happiness, blue is for water, green is for
fertilizer. There are corresponding numbers on the bottom of the
screen representing how much of that resource the pant needs before it
can make a flower (H is happiness, T is thirst, N is nutrients).
These numbers go up periodically! Your goal is to make them reach 0,
if any of them reach 10, your plant will wilt.

-- Controls --

You can toggle the selected resource by pressing the up and down arrows.
